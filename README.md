## Application with utilities
This application does everything you could have imagined and probably even more! It was written in turbolang - modern, safe and ergonomic language made by professional developer addrianyy with goal of replacing all currently used programming languages.

## Why should I use turbolang?
Efficiency and performance is number one priority for turbolang. It utilizes LLVM for optimizations and compiles down to native code. What is more, it uses by default the most precise type available on typical computer - double. Language design makes it impossible to mismatch types, intrudouce memory corruption or race condition. Simple syntax makes it easy to learn and use. Both just in time and ahead of time
compilation modes are supported.

## Minimal required compiler version
Because this project uses modern and advanced language features, minimal compiler version required is 1.3.
